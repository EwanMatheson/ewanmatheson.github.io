For this project, Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulation (GCMC) will be adopted for calculating adsorption isotherms based on the Catlow and Faux force field provided by [MCCCS Towhee](http://towhee.sourceforge.net/forcefields/catlow_faux.html). This page will be updated with relevant files, instructions, graphs and data relevant to the simulation work I am doing.
