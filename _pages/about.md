Introduction
======

Welcome to my website. Here you will find information, files and other useful links related to my PhD.

PhD - Atomically thin layers for energy harvesting and storage.
======

I am a 1st year PhD physics student at [Northumbria University](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/) studying ALD seeded metal oxide nanostructures for hydrogen storage as part of the [Renewable energy North-East Universities (ReNU) CDT](https://renu.northumbria.ac.uk/) programme. I graduated from Northumbria in 2019, with a 1st class degree in physics before undertaking my PhD. My background is primarily in semiconductor phyisics, as this was the focus of many of the taught modules of the course, however I have experience in soft matter physics (polymer physics) having worked on industrial placement with PepsiCo studying various aspects of snacks, including ingredients structure and distribution and glass transitions in potato starch for extruded snacks. 

Throughout this PhD, I will focus primarily on two workstreams; firstly experimental design and analysis of hydrogen storage materials integrated with sensing capability for real-time monitoring of capacitance. I will be investigating the functionality of metal oxides, such as zinc oxide, and doped metal oxides for hydrogen storage, and the utilisation of atomically thin films for measuring changes in electron density as a function of surface gas pressure as a consequence of energy transfer across the barrier layer. Secondly, I will be implementing grand cannonical monte carlo simulations of the gas-sorption process with the aim of producing adsorption isotherms which I can use to adapt the growth parameters for the nanorods, to optimise hydrogen uptake thus reducing the amount of material used when compared to experimentally optimising.

The [(ReNU) CDT](https://renu.northumbria.ac.uk/) is an added value doctoral training programme funded by the EPSRC.

It should be noted that the concentration of magnesium can effect the crystal structure enough to prevent nanowires from growing.
