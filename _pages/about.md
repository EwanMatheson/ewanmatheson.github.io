Introduction
======

I am a 1st year PhD physics student at [Northumbria University](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/) studying ALD seeded metal oxide nanostructures for hydrogen and electrical energy storage. I graduated from Northumbria in 2019, with a 1st class degree in physics before undertaking my PhD. My background is primarily in semiconductor phyisics, as this was the focus of many of the taught modules of the course, however I have experience in soft matter physics (polymer physics) having worked on industrial placement with PepsiCo studying various aspects of snacks, including ingredients structure and distribution and glass transitions in potato starch for extruded snacks. 

My undergraduate project was on investigating the effects of etching and cryogenic decontaminating a CZTSe absorber and CdS buffer layer respectively, with the aim of demonstrating the effect of etchants on the removal of secondary phases from the CZTSe absorber layer, as well as the effect of directionality of the cryogneic snow jet on removing agglomerates from the CdS surface.

The [Renewable energy North-East Universities (ReNU) CDT](https://renu.northumbria.ac.uk/) is an added value doctoral training programme funded by the EPSRC . 

PhD - Atomically thin layers for energy harvesting and storage.
