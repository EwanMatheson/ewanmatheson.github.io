I am a 1st year PhD physics student at [Northumbria University](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/) studying ALD seeded metal oxide nanostructures for hydrogen and electrical storage. I graduated from Northumbria with a 1st class degree in physics in 2019 before undertaking my PhD. My background is primarily in semiconductor phyisics, as this was the focus of many of the taught modules of the course, however I have experience in soft matter physics (polymer physics) having worked on industrial placement with PepsiCo studying various aspects of snacks, including ingredients structure and distribution and glass transitions in potato starch for extruded snacks. 

 The [Renewable energy North-East Universities (ReNU) CDT](https://renu.northumbria.ac.uk/) is an added value doctoral training programme funded by the EPSRC . 

PhD - Atomically thin layers for energy harvesting and storage.
