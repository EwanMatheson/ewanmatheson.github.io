For my project approval, I have written a short [essay](http://ewanmatheson.github.io/files/ProjectApproval.pdf) detailing the background literature, aims and objectives of the project, methodology and controbution to knowledge. Accompanying this is a detailed [one year plan and a four year plan](http://ewanmatheson.github.io/files/Projectplan.pdf) outlining the scope and direction of the project. 

The university provide an assessment panel to read and review the project before questioning it in an oral assessment. For this, I have prepared a short ten minute presentation to which I will dive technically into the mechanisms which I am looking to explore to make the technology for this project work: [Scalable Hydrogen Fuel Technology](https://1drv.ms/p/s!Ak89yQ7zi0fchbAI5y6NDyJOLKVgRw?e=6tgbJJ).
