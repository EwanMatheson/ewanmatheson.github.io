Updates for March to April
=======

This month, I have been working on my presentaiton and revision for the Project Approval. The project approval took place on 10/03/2020 and was successful. I discussed in my presentaiton ([a copy can be found here](https://1drv.ms/p/s!Ak89yQ7zi0fchbAIdc7JBKNIvBTOxA?e=n1U5ry)) the workstreams of this project, starting out by compairing the various storage methods currently used, moving onto the solid state mechanisms, the sensor mechanisms, seed layer effects on nanowires and finally the simulation work. Regarding the seed layer, it was pointed out that the lack of substrate crystallinity may be effecting the seed layer, particularly with the PET. This is causing an amorphous seed layer, resulting in the nanowires not being able to form. It may be worth looking at crystalised substrates.
