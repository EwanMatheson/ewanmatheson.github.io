Updates for March to April
=======

This month, I have been working on my presentaiton and revision for the Project Approval. The project approval took place on 10/03/2020 and was successful. I discussed in my presentaiton ([a copy can be found here](https://1drv.ms/p/s!Ak89yQ7zi0fchbAIdc7JBKNIvBTOxA?e=n1U5ry)) the workstreams of this project, starting out by compairing the various storage methods currently used, moving onto the solid state mechanisms, the sensor mechanisms, seed layer effects on nanowires and finally the simulation work. Regarding the seed layer, it was pointed out that the lack of substrate crystallinity may be effecting the seed layer, particularly with the PET. This is causing an amorphous seed layer, resulting in the nanowires not being able to form. It may be worth looking at crystalised substrates. It was also pointed out that the magnesium content in the EDS scans may be traces within the glass substrate, so it may be worth comparing the peaks to bare glass.

Work
--------

Following from last months solution processing experiment, I have tried growing the nanowires this time with 0.33g of Magnesium Nitrate hexahydrate. This was prepared the same way as before:
Following a similar process as before:
1. Mix 11.9g of Zinc Nitrate Hexahydrate ($\rm Zn(NO_3)_2 \times 6H_2O$) with 1L deionised water to make 1L of 40mM of Zinc Nitrate Solution.
1. Mix 93.75 ml of 40mM Zinc Nitrate solution with 5 (0.33g)mol% of Magnesium Nitrate Hexahydrate ($\rm Mg(NO_3)_2 \times H_2O$). Mix with DI water to make 150ml of 25mM zinc magnesium nitrate solution in a double wall beaker.
1. Add Ammonium Hydroxide ($\rm NH_4OH$) to adjust the pH to 10 - 11. 
1. Add 28.8mg of citric acid ($\rm C_6H_8O_7$).
1. Float the substrate on the surface with the seed layer facing downwards, and leave for up to 180 minutes. 

I measured exactly 0.3326g of Magnesium Nitrate Hexahydrate, and 0.0275g of Citric acid to add to the solution.

I used the right sample substrate for this experiment:

The solution seemed to split, but the reaction products are buoyant and therefore should crystalise to from nanowires.asdasd

As of Monday the 23rd of March, I will be working from home as a response to the governments coronavirus request.
