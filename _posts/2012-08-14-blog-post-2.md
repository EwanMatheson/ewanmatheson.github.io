Updates for Febuary to March
=======

I have worked this month mostly in the lab on ZnO seed layers and CBD for my ZnMgO nanorods. During the first week I was working on the deposition process of the ZnO seed layer using the Teer Coatings sputtering deposition. For this I used PET (Clean and unclean) and glass for reference (green = clean, red = unclean in picture). I processed the substrates for 15 minutes of deposition to create the seed layer. I chose the shorter recipe because I need the seed layer to be as thin as possible to ensure the nanorods grow verticlally along the normal to the substrate. Ideally I would like to do this processing with ALD, as this will improve uniformity in the sample thickness due to its higher deposition precision, and will allow me to make a seed layer thin enough to not only use as a sensor, but also grow the nanowires normal to the substrate.

I also did some chemical bath deposition using the Mg doping recipe onto the PET substrates with seeds as well as the glass with seed. This was done for around 20 minutes to ensure that the troughs of the nanowires were not too thick to prevent any electron transfer should I use this as a recipe for making the sensor. Examing under the SEM, It seems that this process was unsuccessful at producing nanowires. Further to this, what I found confusing is despite the use of the magnesium nitrate hexahydrate, there was no evidence of magnesium examining using EDS. There was also evidence of large and deep cracks through the material, which could be a consequence of the substrate being flexible.

Work
--------

Before the sputtering process, the glass and one of the PET substrates was cleaned according to the following process:

1.	Prepare the cleaning solution, 1 part Decon 90 and 4 parts DI water. 
1.	Clean each substrate both sides thoroughly using toothbrush, and rinse with DI water. Then put it into the sample holder filled with DI water.
1.	Lift and rinse samples in holder 2/3 times and empty. 
1.	Refill with DI water and rinse again.
1.	Repeat steps 2-4. (second wash)
1.	Fill sample holders with small amount of clean solution from Step.1 (about 1 mL), and then fill with DI water, ultrasonic bath for 15 min. 
1.	Rinse with DI water and fill with DI water, ultrasonic again for a further 15 mins. 
1.	After final step, leave samples in clean DI water and dry to put away, make sure to dry thoroughly using N2 flow.

The cleaned PET substrate under inspection in the optical microscope shows signs of water-marks/ residue:

The fabrication of the ZnO seed layers was made using a 15 minute sputter of ZnO target at 20$\rm ^o$C, $\rm 6 \times 10^{-6}$ bar (Pirani), $\rm 1.6 \times 10^{-5}$ bar (Baratron). The substrates were positioned in the substrate holder before being positioned in the chamber.

Upon starting the recipe, the chamber undertook a 5 minute cleaning process with ZnO to prevent contamination from previous recipes, before begining the 15 minute sputtering deposition. 

CBD
--------

Following a similar process as above:
1. Mix 11.9g of Zinc Nitrate Hexahydrate ($\rm Zn(NO_3)_2 \times 6H_2O$) with 1L deionised water to make 1L of 40mM of Zinc Nitrate Solution.
1. Mix 93.75 ml of 40mM Zinc Nitrate solution with 5 (0.33g), 10 (0.66g) or 15mol% (1g) of Magnesium Nitrate Hexahydrate ($\rm Mg(NO_3)_2 \times H_2O$). Mix with DI water to make 150ml of 25mM zinc magnesium nitrate solution in a double wall beaker.
1. Add Ammonium Hydroxide ($\rm NH_4OH$) to adjust the pH to 10 - 11. 
1. Add 28.8mg of citric acid ($\rm C_6H_8O_7$).
1. Float the substrate on the surface with the seed layer facing downwards, and leave for up to 180 minutes. 

This process is prepared in a double walled beaker with 1g of Magnesium nitrate hexahydrate, which is connected up to a hotbath heated to $\rm 90^OC$. The following SEM images are of a Mg doped layer on a ZnO seed layer. The corresponding EDS spectrums follow the images. All images can be accessed [here](https://github.com/EwanMatheson/ewanmatheson.github.io/tree/master/images/ZnMgOSEM/GlassZnO). The images show that the lack of nanowire growth might be down to the high concentration of Mg (1g), adjusting the crystal structure enough to prevent the formation of nanowires. I will need to retry this with a lower concenration of Mg.
