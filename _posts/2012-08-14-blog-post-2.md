Febuary to March
======


You can have many headings
------

During January we had more CDT training, involving Electrical networks and power electronics, the history of Coal in the north east, impacts of climate change on glaciation, low carbon energy solutions for developing countries, social science and Impact training. During this month I changed the long term plan for the project to focus more around the energy application of metal oxides, such as nanostructured dielectrics in capacitors, nanstructures and atomically thin layers in photovoltaics, and nanostructures for hydrogen storage, this being the main focus of the project. I was also trained on the SEM with EDS so I can analyse the surface of my samples, as well as further training on vacuum technology from Kurt Lesker, which had useful information on gas behaviour in chambers. I contacted someone at Newcastle university to enquire about running a BET experiment with my samples to get a rough idea of the gas adsorption of nanostructured ZnO. I will visit to see the set up first to determine if i can do the tests with the substrate, or if it needs to be powdered.
